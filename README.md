# Go String Generator

The Go String Generator is a command-line tool written in Go that generates all possible combinations of a given set of characters and saves them to separate text files. This tool can be useful in scenarios where you need to generate a large number of strings for testing or other purposes.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Make sure you have Go installed on your machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Build the executable by running the following command:
  `go build`
5. Run the executable:
`./go-string-generator`
6. You will be prompted to enter the allowed characters. Provide a string containing all the characters you want to include in the generated strings like: `AbC123`
7. The program will start generating strings and saving them to separate text files. Each file will contain a batch of strings, with each string on a new line.
8. Once the generation process is complete, you will have the strings saved to separate files.
   `output_0.txt, output_1.txt etc etc`
